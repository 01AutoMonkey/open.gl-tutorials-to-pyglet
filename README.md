open.gl-tutorials-to-pyglet
===========================

Translation of the http://open.gl/ OpenGL tutorials from C++ and SFML to Python and Pyglet

TODO:

- Drop dependancy on Tristam's GLSL wrapper to stay more true to the way the tutorial does things.
- The first three parts of the tutorial are done, finish the remaining five.
