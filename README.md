===========================

Translation of the http://open.gl/ OpenGL tutorials from C++ and SFML to Python and Pyglet

TODO:

- The first 5 parts of the tutorial are done, finish the remaining three.
- Get the bug fix of euclid.py into the official repository.
- The texture comes out reversed in 5-1 and 5-2, fix it by altering the tex coordinates.
- Write a tutorial/explination on the differences between the C++/SFML and Python/Pyglet translation.
