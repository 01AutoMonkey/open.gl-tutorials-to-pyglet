===========================

Translation of the http://open.gl/ OpenGL tutorials from C++ and SFML to Python and Pyglet

TODO:

- Include color code even if it's not used in 3-2, 4-1, and 4-2, to stay true to the tutorial.
- The first four parts of the tutorial are done, finish the remaining four.
- Write a tutorial/explination on the differences between the C++/SFML and Python/Pyglet translation.
